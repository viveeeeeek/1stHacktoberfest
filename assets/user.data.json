    "description": "Contributing to Open - source software and projects can appear to be an intimidating task. Your favored search engine will yield a whole slew of resources for getting started, including instructions and repositories. Nevertheless, many times your search does not return the desired results, and even after reading many blog articles, you still do not know how to contribute to Open Source. The tainted legacy of certain enterprises, as well as a scathing undertone, do not assist matters and may further complicate issues. I've been there before. I looked and looked for outstanding Open Source repositories to contribute to, only to discover that I had no idea where to begin. I began focused on other tasks because I was frustrated and disillusioned. Finally, I myself contributed to few Python Projects, CPP, Java DSA ProgramsÂ that were marked (help-wanted) (hacktoberfest-2021). Felt excited and looking forward for more such contributions."
